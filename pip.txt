    $ pip help

# To bring up options for a specific command
    $ pip help 'query'

        returns package name and description of the package
        
# Installing pacakages
    $ pip install SomePackage            # latest version
    $ pip install SomePackage==1.0.4     # specific version
    $ pip install 'SomePackage>=1.0.4'     # minimum version

    $ pip uninstall SomePackage
    
# To list installed packages and their current version
    $ pip list
