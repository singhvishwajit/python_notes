# venv is used to create a virtual environment when using python 3.3 or higher.
# venv helps separate different python environments for different projects. 
# venv creates an isolated environment with dependencies and packages that are installed only in that environment and not globally.
# through venv we can avoid breaking websites when we upgrade packages globally.

# To create a virtual environment
    $ python -m venv name_of_virtual_environement
    
# To activate a virtual environment 
    $ . name_of_virtual_environment/Scripts/activate
    
# To deactivate a virtual environment
    $ deactivate
    
# To remove a virtual environment
    $ rmdir name_of_virtual_environment /s (windows command prompt)
    $ rm -r name_of_virtual_environment   (Gitbash)

# don't commit venv to source control
# commit requirements.txt file instead

# To create environment with system packages
    $ python -m venv venv --system--site-packages
        Additional packages that we install in this virtual environment will not affect system packages

# To check what packages we have installed only in the virtual environment
    $ pip list --local 
    
# To create package list for requirements.txt file for packages we have installed only in the virtual environment
    $ pip freeze --local
