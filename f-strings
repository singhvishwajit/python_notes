# f-strings is a new way to format strings in Python 3.6 and above

# String formatting using format method
	first_name = 'John'
	last_name = 'Doe'

  sentence = 'My name is {} {}'.format(first_name, last_name)
	print(sentence)

# String formatting using f-strings
  sentence = f'My name is {first_name} {last_name}'
	print(sentence)

# Using methods with f-strings
	sentence = f'My name is {first_name.upper()} {last_name.upper()}'
	print(sentence)

# String formatting using format method in case of dictionaries
  person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
	sentence = 'My name is {} and I am {} years old'.format(person['name'], person['age'])
	print(sentence)	
	
# String formatting using f-strings in case of dictionaries 
  sentence = f"My name is {person['name']} and I am {person['age']} years old"
	print(sentence)

# Calculations from within the f-string
  calculation = f'4 times 11 is equal to {4 * 11}'
	print(calculation)

# Advanced formatting within the f-string: 0 pad for 2 digits
  for n in range(1, 11):
		 sentence = f'The  value is {n}'
		 print(sentence)

	for n in range(1, 11):
	  sentence = f'The  value is {n:01}' [0 pad for 2 digits]
	  print(sentence)

# Advanced formatting within the f-string: print to 4 digits of floating point values
	pi = 3.14159265
  sentence = f'Pi is equal to {pi:.4f}' [print to 4 digits of floating point values]
	print(sentence)

# from datetime import datetime

	birthday = datetime(1990, 1, 1)

	sentence = f'John has a birthday on {birthday}'
	print(sentence)
  output: John has a birthday on 1990-01-01 00:00:00 
  
  sentence = f'John has a birthday on {birthday:%B %d, %Y}'
	print(sentence)
  output: John has a birthday on January 01, 1990
